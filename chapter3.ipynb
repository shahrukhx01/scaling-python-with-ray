    "A remote object is just an object, which may be on another node. ObjectRefs are like\n",
    "pointers or IDs to objects that you can use to get the value from, or status of, the\n",
    "remote function. In addition to being created from remote function calls, you can\n",

    "## Remote Functions Lifecycle\n",
    "The invoking Ray process (called the owner) of a remote function schedules the\n",
    "execution of a submitted task and facilitates the resolution of the returned ObjectRef\n",
    "to its underlying value if needed. <br/><br/>\n",
    "On task submission, the owner waits for all dependencies (i.e., ObjectRef objects that\n",
    "were passed as an argument to the task) to become available before scheduling. The\n",
    "dependencies can be local or remote, and the owner considers the dependencies to be\n",
    "ready as soon as they are available anywhere in the cluster. When the dependencies\n",
    "are ready, the owner requests resources from the distributed scheduler to execute the\n",
    "task. Once resources are available, the scheduler grants the request and responds with\n",
    "the address of a worker that will execute the function.<br/><br/>\n",
    "At this point, the owner sends the task specification over gRPC to the worker. After\n",
    "executing the task, the worker stores the return values. If the return values are small\n",
    "(less than 100 KiB by default), the worker returns the values inline directly to the\n",
    "owner, which copies them to its in-process object store. If the return values are large,\n",
    "the worker stores the objects in its local shared memory store and replies to the\n",
    "owner, indicating that the objects are now in distributed memory. This allows the\n",
    "owner to refer to the objects without having to fetch the objects to its local node.\n",
    "When a task is submitted with an ObjectRef as its argument, the worker must resolve\n",
    "its value before it can start executing the task.<br/><br/>\n",
    "Tasks can end in an error. Ray distinguishes between two types of task errors:<br/><br/>\n",
    "**Application-level**<br/>\n",
    "In this scenario, the worker process is alive, but the task ends in an error (e.g., a\n",
    "task that throws an IndexError in Python).<br/><br/>\n",
    "**System-level**<br/>\n",
    "In this scenario, the worker process dies unexpectedly (e.g., a process that seg‐\n",
    "faults, or if the worker’s local Raylet dies).<br/><br/>\n",
    "Tasks that fail because of application-level errors are never retried. The exception\n",
    "is caught and stored as the return value of the task. Tasks that fail because of system-level errors may be automatically retried up to a specified number of attempts."
